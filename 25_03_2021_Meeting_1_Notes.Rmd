Outline: 
* Personal introductions
+ What operating system is Chris using? = windows 
** action item: dani to investigate putty/windows terminal ect for Chris to use 
* Discuss:
+ (i) issues and obstacles related to the 'practice reproducibility review' and xno questions, all good 
+ (ii) questions about the assigned reading, Campbell-Staton et al. 2017 xnope

* Technical Items: 
+ Need to use some sort of groovey text editor that can work with github
+ Text editor (Atom) ?
+ R and RStudio ?
+ Using R-studio projects 
+ Screen share walk through of navigating GitHub:
++ (discuss basic structure and forking vs cloning vs. downloading) - i will ditch forking becuase, well, I dont use it. 
+++ register for a free GitHub account - done
+++ install Git - done 
http://git-scm.com/downloads
which git
git --version
+++ push to / pull from GitHub from the command line? from R studio? from Atom? - we used Rstudio, will do command line and atomnext week 
+++ in R 
+++ can also do on commandline git clone https://github.com/your-username/practice-git-skillz

+ Dryad in R
** we didnt go through this as Chris is familar with R and uses R in her work

```{r, Dryad}
#install.packages("rdryad")
library(rdryad)
library(readxl)
# example: get dryad dataset for reading:
# REF:: Campbell-Staton et al., Science 357, 495â€“498 (2017)

# DOI: 10.1126/science.aam5512
#  Dryad Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/ 10.5061/dryad.g500m.

## see what datasets they have 
dryad_datasets("10.5061/dryad.g500m")
data.doi = rdryad::dryad_download("10.5061/dryad.g500m") # is it in d .R_Cache
data.doi # there is an xlsx file
# what is it?
head(readxl::read_xlsx(data.doi[[1]], sheet = 1))
dim(readxl::read_xlsx(data.doi[[1]], sheet = 1))
# remove it 
rm(list = ls())
```


* Sam + Katherines instructions 
Mentors will introduce interns to the basic structure behind these repositories, how to gather information describing a given dataset or script, and downloading/copying data. Interns should try to download or clone data from each repository. 

o	With help from mentors, interns should practice cloning from GitHub using git clone in their terminal after installing git.Students should then install the package 'rdryad' to R using 'install.packages("rdryad")' and download a dataset using the function 'download_dryad()' input with the doi of a Dryad repository of interest.
Once these meetings have occurred, Katherine and I will share resources to interns so they can learn about, install, and open Jupyter notebooks, a report format for Python similar to R markdown (referenced in last week's reading by Karl Broman).
